# SQL Case Study: Book Store Sales

Here is a fantastic Data Analyst case study to check SQL knowledge.

## Project Description

An online bookstore that wants to maximize sales and customer pleasure is the subject of our case study. Your job as a data analyst is to examine sales data and provide conclusions to enhance company performance. You can find patterns, client preferences, and growth prospects by examining data from your books, customers, orders, and sales. In order to increase sales and strengthen the position of the online bookshop in the marketplace, your analysis will help guide decisions about inventory management, marketing initiatives, and customer engagement.
